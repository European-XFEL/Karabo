# Building

## Building from command-line ###

The quickest way to build the Karabo framework is by using the auto_build_all.sh script. Simply execute:
    
    ./auto_build_all.sh

and get informed how to use this script.


# Documentation

An extensive documentation is available in the `doc` folder.
Build the documentation using

    cd doc
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    make html

Or use the documentation available at this [link](https://rtd.xfel.eu/docs/karabo/en/latest/)
or the old [link](https://in.xfel.eu/readthedocs/docs/karabo/en/latest/)

Thank you for using Karabo!
