PUSHD %WIN_CONDA_ROOT%

REM conda cannot remove directories on windows.
REM the origin of the issue seems to be the fact that the main
REM dll files are linked from the base environment.
REM For some reason, windows will lock the files in the environment
REM to the executable of the CI (python) preventing the CI
REM from cleaning itself. Here we choose the nuclear option of
REM wiping everything clean.

REM clean the conda-bld directory
PUSHD conda-bld
DEL /q /f /s * > nul
POPD
RMDIR /q /s conda-bld
MKDIR conda-bld

REM remove all environments
PUSHD envs
DEL /q /f /s * > nul
POPD
RMDIR /q /s envs
MKDIR envs
POPD
