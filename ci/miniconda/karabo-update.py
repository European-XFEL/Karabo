"""
This is a wrapper for the conda CLI install commands, tailored for
Karabo installations/updates on packed environment. This is needed because
`conda` is not included on the pack and not all machines has it installed.

In the future, we could the check packed environment list of packages and
versions and extract the environment to the current folder such that we
will be less dependent on the (mirror) conda-forge."""
