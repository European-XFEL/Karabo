The coverage folder is intended to be outside the Karabo source tree. 
Use the 'conf' file to define the path to the Karabo source folder and the 'lcov' tool folder.

- The gen_report script makes sure that the following links are generated in the build tree:
    /home/osboxes/karabo/build/netbeans/karabo/build/Debug
           src -> /home/osboxes/karabo/src

    /home/osboxes/karabo/build/netbeans/integrationTests/build/Debug
           src -> /home/osboxes/karabo/src


- Make sure that karabo (Debug) is compiled with the code coverage flags

- Make sure that integrationTests (Debug) is compiled with the code coverage flags

- Run the gen_initial

- Run the gen_report
