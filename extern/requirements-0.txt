# installing these first will speed up a lot of other things
# on the main requirements. This is basically because pip seems
# to have a hard time sorting out a dependency chain that requires
# numpy, and scipy in a lot of places. Hence we install
# them here first.
numpy==1.21.4 --install-option="--no-binary numpy"  # if we don't have openblas available, we need to build from sources, so BLAS is used
scipy==1.6.3 --install-option="--no-binary scipy"

# since pip seems to consider building from source preferable to wheels
# for any entry in a requirement file, in which a single entry specifies
# such an option, we also add all other packages which require this here.
pyzmq==22.3.0 --install-option="--no-binary pyzmq"
