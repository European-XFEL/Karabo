# hdf5/1.8.21 for now going via download of package because Cmake will not reliably find the conan build.

# boost/1.69.0 #- succeeds locally, but not on any of the CIs, falling back to local build.
cppunit/1.15.1
libjpeg/9c
libtiff/4.0.8

# any
# cmake/3.25.2 - this is too big of a version jump for CentOs7, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44205687/glibcxx-3-4-21-not-found-on-centos-7
libev/4.33
# nss/3.88.1 # - our custom one uses the system version, which leads to less runtime conflicts. Specifically, CentOs7 and Ubuntu20+ will not find a commen version due to a NSSUTIL conflict
# we could use this if we update the framework
# redboltz-mqtt_cpp/13.0.0

# forced - these are pinned to allow conan to resolve dependency conflicts

[options]
# We intend to use shared libraries
*:shared=True

# These options will become relevant, when we install boost using conan
# I keep them here for documentation already, as this is bound to happen.
# 
# boost needs python: this is important, as otherwise we end up with an 
# installation that is not usable for karabo.bound. 
# However, this also means that boost will be compiled from source!
#
# boost:without_python=False
#
# the boost recipe for conan has an issue with finding libbackrace
# https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/issues/13448
# this likely will be fixed in newer boost releases
