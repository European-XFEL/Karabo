# GlassFish(tm) Message Queue Broker init.d script
#
# This script starts/stops the Message Queue broker process as part of 
# normal UNIX system operation based on the value of the
# AUTOSTART in the /etc/opt/imq/imqbrokerd.conf file.
#
# To debug this script, set the environmental variable
# DEBUG to 1 (true)
#
# e.g.
# env DEBUG=1 /etc/init.d/imq start
#
# This file is installed as:
#     /etc/init.d/imq
#
# It is linked into the rc*.d directories as:
#	# ln imq /etc/rc3.d/S52imq
#	# ln imq /etc/rc0.d/K15imq
#	# ln imq /etc/rc1.d/K15imq
#	# ln imq /etc/rc2.d/K15imq
#
# The S52imq link in /etc/rc3.d will start the broker when
# the system enters multiuser mode. The K15imq links in
# rc0.d, rc1.d and rc2.d will bring down the broker when the
# system is brought down to single user, or administrative modes.
#
# The script looks at the file:  /etc/imq/imqbrokerd.conf to
# determine whether or not the broker should be started.
