#
#  There exist several targets which are by default empty and which can be 
#  used for execution of your targets. These targets are usually executed 
#  before and after some main targets. They are: 
#
#     .build-pre:              called before 'build' target
#     .build-post:             called after 'build' target
#     .clean-pre:              called before 'clean' target
#     .clean-post:             called after 'clean' target
#     .clobber-pre:            called before 'clobber' target
#     .clobber-post:           called after 'clobber' target
#     .all-pre:                called before 'all' target
#     .all-post:               called after 'all' target
#     .help-pre:               called before 'help' target
#     .help-post:              called after 'help' target
#
#  Targets beginning with '.' are not intended to be called on their own.
#
#  Main targets can be executed directly, and they are:
#  
#     build                    build a specific configuration
#     clean                    remove built files from a configuration
#     clobber                  remove all built files
#     all                      build all configurations
#     help                     print help mesage
#  
#  Targets .build-impl, .clean-impl, .clobber-impl, .all-impl, and
#  .help-impl are implemented in nbproject/makefile-impl.mk.
#
#  Available make variables:
#
#     CND_BASEDIR                base directory for relative paths
#     CND_DISTDIR                default top distribution directory (build artifacts)
#     CND_BUILDDIR               default top build directory (object files, ...)
#     CONF                       name of current configuration
#     CND_PLATFORM_${CONF}       platform name (current configuration)
#     CND_ARTIFACT_DIR_${CONF}   directory of build artifact (current configuration)
#     CND_ARTIFACT_NAME_${CONF}  name of build artifact (current configuration)
#     CND_ARTIFACT_PATH_${CONF}  path to build artifact (current configuration)
#     CND_PACKAGE_DIR_${CONF}    directory of package (current configuration)
#     CND_PACKAGE_NAME_${CONF}   name of package (current configuration)
#     CND_PACKAGE_PATH_${CONF}   path to package (current configuration)

# latest NetBeans build on this platform, otherwise they exist already.
# Copy option -p is relevant, otherwise the copies might look newer than a
# changed Karabo-*-$(CURRENT_PLATFORM), received from git update.

# The following two includes lead to warnings from make ("No such file or

# (see https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Include.html).
# But then it will create the files according to the above rules. In fact, even
# if the files were not missing, they might need to be recreated before used!

# nbproject/Makefile-$(CONF).mk is not included here, but is used in all
# the .*-impl targets used above (and defined in Makefile-impl.mk).
# To take care that it exists before the .validate-impl target in
# Makefile-impl.mk checks that, we add it here as a prerequisite.
# Since this target is really internal to the NetBeans generated
# Makefile-impl.mk, this should be considered a HACK around the fact that there
# the *-pre targets appear as prerequisites in parallel with .validate.impl,
# i.e. we cannot simply make the .*-pre targets depend on Makefile-$(CONF).mk
# here. That is because then the check might still be executed before the
# .*-pre target that leads to the creation of Makefile-$(CONF).mk.
# Hope that people reading this could follow...
