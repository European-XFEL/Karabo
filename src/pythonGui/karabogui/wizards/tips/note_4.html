<p>
    Did you know that it is possible to deactivate High DPI?
</p>

<br>
The Karabo GUI evaluates on startup if a high dpi configuration of Qt should be used.
This feature is normally working nicely, but can cause problems on systems with a very
high dpi value, e.g. resulting in very large icons.
</br>
In order to disable the automatic high dpi setting, please check mark
<p>
    <b>Settings -> High DPI</b>
