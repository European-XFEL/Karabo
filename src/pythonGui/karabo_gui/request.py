    take a single `Hash` as an argument and reply with a `Hash`.

                    is lost. In that case, `success` is False, and `reply`
                    should be ignored.
                    In case the call fails or times out, `success` is also
                    False and `reply` may or may not contain useful info.

    can seriously degrade performance of devices external to the GUI server.
