         * @brief The AlarmService device keeps track of alarms raised in the distributed system. 
         * 
         * The AlarmService device keeps track of alarms raised in the distributed system.
         * It registers itself to the alarm signals and maintains a list of currently known alarms,
         * when they were first and last raised, their severity, additional information and whether
         * they need acknowledging before they disappear.
         * 
         * The device provides interfaces for clients to query this information and interact with 
         * the alarms known to the system. Specifically, clients may send requests to acknowledge 
         * a pending alarm.
         * 
         * Additionally, the alarm service periodically saves alarms it manages to disk. This is done
         * to allow for quick recovery from system wide errors: if the alarm service for which-ever
         * reason needs to be restarted, it will query only the differences of the last persisted 
         * alarms from the distributed system. For this purpose a storagePath and flushIntervall may
         * be configured in the device's expected parameters.
