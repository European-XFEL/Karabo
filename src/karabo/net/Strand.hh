         * A poor man's substitute for boost::asio::io_service::strand because that does not guarantee that
         * handlers posted on different strands can run in parallel ("strand collision").
         * Compared to boost::asio::io_service::strand, this
         * - lacks dispatch:               we usually do not want that in Karabo since it allows the handler to be
         *                                 called now in this scope
         * - lacks running_in_this_thread: probably not too important
         * - has a more restrictive wrap:  would be useful to support more, but a proper implementation would also
         *                                 need dispatch
         *
         * Every handler posted will be put into a FIFO queue and the FIFO will be emptied one-by-one in the background
         * by posting the handlers to the boost::asio::io_service given in the constructor.
         *
         * NOTE:
         * Do not create a Strand on the stack, but do it on the heap using a shared pointer:
         *
         * auto stack = boost::make_shared<Strand>(karabo::net::EventLoop::getIOService());
         *
         * Otherwise 'enable_shared_from_this' does not work which is needed to guarantee (via usage of
         * karab::util::bind_weak) that an internal Strand method is executed on the event loop when the Strand
         * is already destructed.
