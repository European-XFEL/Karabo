# 'ContinuationIndentWidth' should be set to a value greater than 'IndentWidth'
# to avoid wrapped function parameters lists having the same indentation as the
# function's body. In Google style 'IndentWidth' is '4' and 'AlignAfterOpenBracket'
# is 'DontAlign' (if 'AlignAfterOpenBracket' is set to 'Align', the setting for
# 'ContinuationIndentWidth' won't make a difference for the long parameters list
# scenario).
