To create the windows installer, type in the console:

"python setup.py bdist_wininst"

A folder called "dist" is created which contains the executable for Windows.
We assume that "Python(x,y)" is already installed on the Windows machine.

The executable for "Python(x,y)" can be found here: https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/wiki/Downloads

Needed packages: PyQt4, guidata, guiqwt etc.
