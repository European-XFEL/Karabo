Next Steps to release Karabo to the public
==========================================

[ ] Write a LICENSE.md file

[ ] Adapt the CONTRIBUTING.md

[ ] Add an example header in ``src/``

[ ] Add a linter to CI check that all files have the headers (do not fail the CI)

[ ] Add the license header on each file

[ ] Enable the linter CI (probably together with the previous step)
