#   How to compile my device?  #
################################

(1) Navigate to the build directory and type

    make

    Optionally specify CONF=Debug or CONF=Release for a debug
    or release build (default: Debug)


(2) For coding/compiling using netbeans, open the folder 
    containing this README as netbeans project


################################
#    How to test my device?    #
################################

(1) Navigate to the run directory

(2) Start Master Device Server

    Navigate to masterDeviceServer and type:

    ./startMasterDeviceServer

    NOTE: If the master crashes whilst starting up, check that no other master server is already running!
          Only on master server can run at a time!!  


(3) Deploy (device-)plugin 

    Navigate to deviceServer and make sure your device plugin (the shared library that you built for your device) is loaded to the plugins folder.
    If this folder is empty you must create a link to your plugin. Simply navigate into the plugins folder and type:
    
    ln -sf ../../../dist/<CONF>/<PLATFORM>/<DEVICE_NAME>.so

    With "< >" representing built/device specific names.


(4) Navigate back to run directory and start a Device Server by typing:

    ./startDeviceServer

    NOTE: Type "./startDeviceServer --help" for displaying more startup options/help


(5a) Start the GUI to control/monitor your device

    ./startGui

    NOTE: Press the connect-icon on the upper left in the GUI. Use the default values of the pop-up dialog and press the connect button.

(5b) Or alternatively start the command line interface by typing

    ./startCli


HINT:

You can run your Device in stand-alone mode (without Device Server) by starting the project-associated test in NetBeans.
If you are using the command-line interface you can even skip to start the Master Device Server!!


GENERAL NOTE:

  Steps (2), (3), and (5) are typically needed to be done only once. 
  If you have an updated version of your device (recompiled code) it should be sufficient to kill (Ctrl-c) and restart the DeviceServer (see (3)).

  If you see a problem with your device, just kill your Device Server (./startServer script) go to the code, recompile
  and start the server again.
