#   How to compile my device server  #
######################################

(1) Navigate to the `server` directory and type

    make

    Optionally specify CONF=Debug or CONF=Release for a debug
    or release build (default: Debug)


(2) For coding/compiling using netbeans, open the folder 
    `server` this README as netbeans project

    Note: If you are adding/deleting source files you need an 
    initial build with NetBeans for regenerating the `Makefile`

#   How to run my device server  #
##################################

Once compiled navigate within the `server` folder to

     dist/<CONF>/<PLATFORM>

and start the executable like 

    ./<DEVICE_SERVER> test

with `test` being the instance name of your server
which must be unique in a Karabo system. 


GENERAL NOTE:

  If you have an updated version of your device (recompiled code) it should be sufficient to kill (Ctrl-c) and restart the DeviceServer.

  If you see a problem with your device, just kill your device server (Ctrl-c), go to the code, recompile
  and start the server again.
