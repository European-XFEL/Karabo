# This script will be sourced in bash context within the top installation script
# This means you can use bash functionality to your liking.
# Finally you need to run make to package and install your dependency.
# The general idea is to compile/install locally, if necessary fix RPATH in shared libraries, 
# create an installation package and then use it to install your dependency in final location
#
# Following variables are available from outside:
#
# KARABO          The location of the karaboFramework base directory
# KARABOVERSION   version of karabo used
# PYTHON          The python interpreter
#
# MACHINE       architecture (x86_64, i686)
# OS            system (Linux, Darwin)
#
# DISTDIR        directory for local installation
#
# Python dependencies should be built as wheels.

# DEP_NAME should point to the folder where source code files are located
# independent if it's an external or internal developed Python project
# (e.g. requests-2.7.0)
# Package source available at: https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests
#
DEP_NAME="dependency_name-dependency_version"

# If source is zipped or tarred
# unzip -q $DEP_NAME.zip
# tar -xvf $DEP_NAME.tar.gz

pushd $DEP_NAME/

echo "=====> $PYTHON setup.py bdist_wheel >> [$DEP_NAME] <====="
$PYTHON setup.py bdist_wheel

# Python *.whl file needs to be placed in package directory
cp dist/*.whl ../package/

popd

# Remove if source was zipped or tarred
# rm -rf $DEP_NAME/
