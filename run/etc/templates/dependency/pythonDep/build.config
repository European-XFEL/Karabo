# This script will be sourced in bash context within the top installation script
# This means you can use bash functionality to your liking.
# Finally you need to run make to package and install your dependency.
# The general idea is to compile/install locally, if necessary fix RPATH in shared libraries, 
# create an installation package and then use it to install your dependency in final location
#
# Following variables are available from outside:
#
# KARABO          The location of the karaboFramework base directory
# KARABOVERSION   version of karabo used
# PYTHON          The python interpreter
#
# MACHINE       architecture (x86_64, i686)
# OS            system (Linux, Darwin)
#
# DISTDIR        directory for local installation
#
# Python dependencies should be built as wheels.
