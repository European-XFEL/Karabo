What's New in Karabo 2.16.5
***************************

This patch release fixes the `Windows` installation of the karaboGui and
aligns the key strokes on `Scenes` to avoid that they coincide with the Ubuntu workspace swapping.
Another mandatory fix for the data loggers is provided. Since the new influx database cluster disconnects after
two seconds of idle connection, most schema updates (including the initial schema) were erroneously discarded.
A minor fix to enable starting bound devices on middlelayer servers is provided as well.

***************************
What's New in Karabo 2.16.3
***************************

This patch release mainly improves the middlelayer api by allowing `noDefaultValue` (NoneValue) on properties
that have an `Assignment.INTERNAL` declaration.
A minor fix is provided for the bound api on requesting the latest logs of a device server.
If no devices have been running on the server, the slot call did not return previously.

***************************
What's New in Karabo 2.16.1
***************************

This patch release:

* fixes a datalogger connection issue found in a lab installation,
* offers performance improvements for output channels in a C++ device for
  the case that input channels connect with onSlowness="queueDrop" (see
  documentation of new *safeNDArray* flag in Device::writeChannel and
  OutputChannel::update),
* hardens the Middlelayer API in tests,
* changes the behavior of MDL's *sanitize_write_configuration*. Now the properties declared
  as Assignment.INTERNAL in the runtime schema are included in the configuration, before they
  were filtered out,
* provides a convenient `AsyncTimer` handling (stop of timer at end of device lifetime),
* and includes some validation and future proofing improvements in the GUI
  client.

What's New in Karabo 2.16.0
***************************

This section shows the new features in Karabo 2.16.0, compared to 2.15.0.
The use of this version of the GUI is encouraged without the need of upgrading the Karabo Servers.
This release is **backwards compatible** until version **2.11**.

Summary â€“ Release highlights
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- GUI Dependency upgrade:

  - Upgrade of Python to 3.8
  - PyQt5 to 5.15.
  - PyQtGraph to 0.13.1

- GUI: Most controllers that can add multiple properties support removal of properties
- Preparing GUI Server for user authentication
- Improve the Pipeline reconnection performance

  - MDL: InputChannels provide information about their missing connections
  - MDL: Always try to reconnect pipeline channel even if the remote channel does not exist yet (schema injection)

Features
++++++++

- GUI: Editable controllers can have multiple properties. This enables future controllers in extensions, e.g. schema
  independent validation of values.
- GUI/MDL: Macros know the name of the project they belong to
- GUI: Table elements have key strokes:

    - CTRL + N: New row
    - DEL: Remove row
    - SHIFT + UP: Move row up
    - SHIFT + DOWN: Move row down

- GUI: Row in reconfigurable table elements can be moved with mouse dragging
- GUI: Table elements support the display type ``TableVectorButton`` for vector properties to provide a dialog for editing
- GUI: Rework of the ListEdit dialog for vector properties. Now elements can be edited with double click, new elements can be added
  with CTRL + N, etc.
- GUI: Historic Data can now also be retrieved for vector of strings
- GUI: Popup the mainwindow or Configuration Editor with **CTRL + ALT** key stroke on scene.
- GUI: Provide information about `archivePolicy`` and `assignment` in the Configurator Popup
- GUI: Toggling of auto range now auto focuses and selects the minimum value in the range dialogs for plot and Lut for images.
- GUI: Addition of `BaseLineEditController` class that can be reused by **guiextensions**
- GUI: Image Widgets can be **undocked**. The underlying model information is copied and a resizable controller is launched
- GUI: Configurator shows now the Health Status `UNKNOWN` for the properties.
- GUI: Health status `UNKNOWN` implemented in the project view.
- GUI: Filtering in device capability dialog
- GUI: Hovering over a project item will show the last date when the item was stored (UTC time)
- GUI: Reactive gui client login that can be activated via the client application dialog.
- GUI: Initial table element display performance increased by a factor of 2.
- MDL: Addition of `AsyncTimer` class as utility feature for postponing or repeating tasks

Bugfixes
++++++++

- GUI: Display widget for vectors will elide their text if the text exceeds the widget width
- GUI: Target tool (inspector) of the plot widget now handles timestamps and states properly
- GUI: Font size fixes for **MacOS** in the font editing of widgets
- GUI: All editable controllers have been fixed for **MacOS**, so that they can apply values with **Enter** key stroke.
- MDL: Clients (e.g. ikarabo) will always send their slotInstanceGone
- MDL: Only the top-level macros are instantiated. Addresses a Macro bug for macros using inheritance
- Solved a Datalogger issue for data containing NaNs and Infinities

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

None

Change of behaviour
+++++++++++++++++++

- The DaemonManager has a different appearence showcasing the `displayType` extension
  for table elements.
- GUI: The Client uses a generic protocol for the ProjectManager and requires a GUI Server device with version **2.13.X**
- GUI: The table drag & drop feature from the project or navigation panel has been removed. Use a dialog via right click on the table cell to enter a deviceId.
- GUI: If a property without default value specified `options`, the client was previously adding the first option as default value. This has been removed and
  the client treats no default value correctly!
- GUI: External SVG Elements on the scene cannot anymore selected.
- GUI: The enum `MouseMode` has been renamed to `MouseTool` to not collide with the external dependency **pyqtgraph**. Backward compatibility is available
  for guiextensions, but will be deprecated in the next release.
- MDL: The InputChannel property `connectedOutputChannels` changed the access mode from `RECONFIGURABLE` to `INITONLY` to align with the C++/Bound counterpart.
