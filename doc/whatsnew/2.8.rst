**************************
What's New in Karabo 2.8.0
**************************

The **most relevant improvements**, fixes and changes are:

- GUI: The EditableOptionsBox has been deprecated and is no longer supported

- Bound API: Method 'validate' of Validator object returns tuple: (flag, error, validated)
             In case 'flag' is false, it would have raised an exception before.
