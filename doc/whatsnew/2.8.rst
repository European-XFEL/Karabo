**************************
What's New in Karabo 2.8.0
**************************

The **most relevant improvements**, fixes and changes are:

- GUI: The EditableOptionsBox has been deprecated and is no longer supported
- GUI: The Workflow widgets have been deprecated and are no longer supported

- Bound API: Method 'validate' of Validator object returns tuple: (flag, error, validated)
             In case 'flag' is false, it would have raised an exception before.

- C++ API: The pugiXML dependency has been moved as a dependency.
           Headers can be found in the ``extern/include`` directory instead of
           ``include/karabo/pugiXml``. e.g. the ``include`` statements like
           ``#include <karabo/pugiXml/pugixml.hpp>`` should become
           ``#include <pugixml.hpp>``

          The ``BaseDevice`` class has only methods used by the ``DeviceServer``.
          Although no device code should make use of these methods, it is possible
          that some unit tests working against earlier version of Karabo will
          break. A pattern that was observed is: A unit test uses `BaseDevice::create`
          method to test the ability of a server to instantiate a device and
          tests the device's behaviour using ``Device`` specific methods, e.g.
          ``getCurrentConfiguration``. This test should be adapted to either
          cast the ``BaseDevice::Pointer`` to a ``Device::Pointer`` with a
          ``boost::dynamic_pointer_cast`` or by calling the public method
          ``slotGetCofiguration``.
