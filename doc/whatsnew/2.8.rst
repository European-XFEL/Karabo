**************************
What's New in Karabo 2.8.0
**************************

The **most relevant improvements**, fixes and changes are:

- GUI: The EditableOptionsBox has been deprecated and is no longer supported
- GUI: The Workflow widgets have been deprecated and are no longer supported

- Bound API: Method 'validate' of Validator object returns tuple: (flag, error, validated)
             In case 'flag' is false, it would have raised an exception before.

- C++ API: The pugiXML dependency has been moved as a dependency.
           Headers can be found in the ``extern/include`` directory instead of
           ``include/karabo/pugiXml``. e.g. the ``include`` statements like
           ``#include <karabo/pugiXml/pugixml.hpp>`` should become
           ``#include <pugixml.hpp>``

          The ``BaseDevice`` class has only methods used by the ``DeviceServer``.
          Although no device code should make use of these methods, it is possible
          that some unit tests working against earlier version of Karabo will
          break. A pattern that was observed is: A unit test uses `BaseDevice::create`
          method to test the ability of a server to instantiate a device and
          tests the device's behaviour using ``Device`` specific methods, e.g.
          ``getCurrentConfiguration``. This test should be adapted to either
          cast the ``BaseDevice::Pointer`` to a ``Device::Pointer`` with a
          ``boost::dynamic_pointer_cast`` or by calling the public method
          ``slotGetCofiguration``.

- MDL API: The `Image` element is now supported natively and DAQ compatible!


Detailed Merge-Log
==================

Bound/cpp core
++++++++++++++

- Bound: proper lock protection in deviceSchema and config parameters of the device always need lock protection to avoid race conditions. !4062
- Bound: PythonDevice.get - copy hash and its vector. It should not be possible to change the content of PythonDevice._parameters without the proper lock. !4081
- Bound: optionally set server hostname !4094
- Bound: Fix silent validation exceptions (BOUND API) !4152
- Bound: 'readOnly' attribute for TableElements in Bound-Python. !4212
- Bound: Fix putting list into hash with integer as large as uint64 !4167
- C++: no extra thread for server process !4057
- C++: Validation parameters in C++ !4158
- C++: Enforce row schema for table elements. Tables without row description make no sense - and harm the GUI. !4100
- C++: optionally set server hostname !4095
- C++: Fix file logger index file !4130
- C++: Fix synchronous code paths in asyncReadXY. These paths have to read all (not only '_some') data. !4146
- C++: Table element 'connections' in the 'OutputPanel' configuration is now readOnly. !4178
- C++: Trust train ids from time server even if reset. Before, the C++ sever assumed strongly monotonous increase of train ids. !4193
- C++: Add filter for network appender !4204 !4220
- C++: Log topic and avoid using any _beats topic !4153
- C++: all SignalSlotable now carry a "type" in instanceInfo !4226
