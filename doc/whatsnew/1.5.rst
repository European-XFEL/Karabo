What's New in Karabo 1.5
************************

This chapter explains the changes in Karabo 1.5 with respect to the 1.4 releases.


Shell Environment Changes
=========================

The ``~/.karabo`` directory is no longer being relied up for locating the currently
installed Karabo framework. Instead, an activation script is created when
building or installing Karabo which makes necessary modifications to the shell
environment so that Karabo can run. A more in-depth description is available at
:ref:`run-scripts`.


API Backward Incompatibilities
==============================

``erase(key)`` and ``eraseFound(key)`` of ``Hash`` and ``OrderedMap``
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The method ``erase`` does not anymore throw an exception if given a
non-existing key.
Instead, a return value indicates whether something has been removed or not.
Since that was exactly the behaviour of ``eraseFound(key)`` before,
that method has been removed.
