  What's New in Karabo 1.5
****************************

This chapter explains the changes in Karabo 1.5 with respect to the 1.4 releases.


Backward Incompatibilities
==========================

``erase(key)`` and ``eraseFound(key)`` of ``Hash`` and ``OrderedMap``
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The method ``erase`` does not throw an exception if given a non-existing key.
Instead, a return value indicates whether something has beenremoved or not.
Since that was exactly the behaviour of ``eraseFound(key)``,
that method has been removed.
