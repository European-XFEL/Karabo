Summary â€“ Release highlights
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

- C++/Bound: The default value of the safeNDArray flag of the methods
  Device.writeChannel and OutputChannel.update have been switched back to true
  for safety.
  On the other hand the copyAllData flag of OutputChannel.write is ignored now
  and the method behaves as if previously the flag was false.
