***************************
What's New in Karabo 2.19.4
***************************

This patch release contains **Redhat9** support and two fixes for the `karaboGUI` client.
Now the Region Of Interest of the Graph Widgets can be moved around freely and the editor can
be raised from the scene view again.

- ci(RedHat 9): Add RedHat 9 support to the CI !8121
- GUI: Remove setting boundary for ROI !8132
- fix(GUI): fix raising of editor on scene view !8139

***************************
What's New in Karabo 2.19.3
***************************

This patch release is directed towards the latest topology errors. Before, an instance update
received a device that is not yet present in the topology is rejected. This is correct behavior,
but did lead to a lot of false topologies.
Now an instance update will complete a topology again. Note that for 2.20.X this behavior is reverted again.

- Revert "C++: Protect from false instanceUpdate receival --- be verbose on faulty messages" (Cherry pick 2.19.X)


***************************
What's New in Karabo 2.19.2
***************************

This patch release is directed to the dataloggers. After the change in 2.19.0 to always create
a new client for an influx request, schema retrievals did cause the dataloggers to segfault.
Now a single client is retained and always disconnected after the requests.

- perf(InfluxLogger): single DbClient for reading, disconnect when idle (2.19.X-hotfix)


***************************
What's New in Karabo 2.19.1
***************************

This patch release brings a few **concert** fixes and improvements and aligns *nan* value
behavior in the trendline widget to 2.18.X.

- GUI: Add target window to concert open scene (2.19.1 hotfix) !7969
- GUI: Add karabo concert directory (2.19.1 hotfix) !7973
- GUI: karabo-concert from GUI (2.19.1 hotfix) !7985
- GUI: Fix levels dialog accounting zero values (Cherry-pick hotfix 2.19) !8000
- GUI: Trendlines always draw connect array dots (Cherry-pick hotfix) !8005
- C++: Explicitly disable connections in OutputChannel destructor (Backport to 2.19) !7986
- C++: Enable TCP keep alive via configuration options (Backport to 2.19) !7987
- C++: Input channel uses TCP keep-alive (Backport to 2.19) !7988
- MDL: Declare default socket variables for pipeline channel table (2.19.X hotfix) !7990
- Influx: Avoid access to the front of an empty queue (UB) (2.19.X-hotfix) !8007


***************************
What's New in Karabo 2.19.0
***************************

Release date was November 13, 2023.


Summary â€“ Release highlights
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

GUI Logbook, AMQP broker production ready, C++/Bound pipeline enhancements,
dependency updates, and more:

- GUI: **LogBook support!** Scenes, configs, etc. can be send with annotation to
  an electronic log book backend. Device was developed for Zulip ELOG at EuXFEL.
- GUI: A new application mode besides *karabo-cinema* and *karabo-theatre* is
  provided, the **karabo-concert**.
  From a running GUI, a yaml file can be created that stores information about
  open scenes and their position on the screen.
  If this yaml file is passed to *karabo-concert*, scenes are positioned
  accordingly.
- GUI: XY Plots now gracefully accept vectors of different length.
- All API: First official production release supporting the Rabbit MQ (AMQP)
  broker.
- C++: To auto start devices, device servers now support an `init` configuration
  option with the same (json) syntax as MDL (`autoStart` still supported).
- Bound: As in C++, *updateState* now supports to update further properties in
  one go with the state.
- C++/Bound: Under the hood, output channels now send data asynchronously.
  *Device.writeChannel* and *OutputChannel.update* stay synchronous for
  backward compatibility, but *OutputChannel.asyncUpdate[NoWait]* offers the
  full benefit of being asynchronous.
- C++/Bound: To control which of the input channels connected with "shared"
  data distribution, device code can now register a *SharedInputSelector* at an
  output channel.
- All API: A new *slotGetSystemInfo* for devices provides information about
  their broker connection, timing information and user.
- Python API: All device templates are now provided with a toml structure.
  The framework supports and is now aligned to PEP621 (https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/).
  All device tags must follow PEP440 (https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/).
- Various dependency updates (`boost`, `numpy`,...) as outlined below.

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

- Macro: Before 2.19.0, the class name was appended to the original deviceId, resulting in DeviceID-ClassName.
  From 2.19.0 onwards, this has been removed and all gui scenes referring to macros need to be adjusted.
- C++/Bound ImageData header has been removed, see migration guidelines.
- C++/Bound: DetectorGeometry has been removed, see migration guidelines.
- C++: Removal of the Motor and Camera interface class.
- Bound/C++: The default value of the *safeNDArray* flag of the methods
  *Device.writeChannel* and *OutputChannel.update* have been switched back to
  true (as was the case before 2.18.0) for safety.
  On the other hand the *copyAllData* flag of *OutputChannel.write* is ignored
  now and the method behaves as if previously the flag was false.
- C++: The 'disributionMode' configuration for shared connections of an
  OutputChannel is now ignored. The behaviour matches the old default
  (load-balanced) except if the new *SharedInputSelector* feature is used.
- MDL: The `Injectable` class, being an empty class placeholder for quite a while, has been removed. See migration guidelines.
- MDL: The middlelayer_api namespace is not anymore availabe, see migration guidelines.
- AlarmService: The alarm service has been removed from the framework. A new alarm device implementation will be provided outside of the framework.

Change of behaviour
+++++++++++++++++++

- Macro: instanceInfo status is always `ok`
- All API: device servers don't regularly scan plugins anymore. This feature has been removed from C++ and MDL.
  The device plugins are only scanned once on startup.
- All API: The pipeline option `queue` has been deprecated and is treated as `queueDrop` if configured.
- GUI: All runtime attribute configurations are not available anymore. This fades out the alarm attribute configuration from the Configurator.
- C++/Bound: Output channel schema default values are not included anymore in the device configuration. This is visible when calling
  *slotGetConfiguration*.
- All API: The heartbeat information does not include anymore the full instance info, only the instance type and interval.

Migration Guidelines
++++++++++++++++++++

General remarks:

- A lot of device repositories (python) make use of the *isort* package.
This package orders the imports. Please activate a karabo installation and type *isort .*
in the repository folder in case imports are not ordered according to CI failure.

1.
From 2.19.X onwards the namespace **middlelayer_api** has been removed.
The only supported namespaces for device developers to import from are: *karabo.middlelayer*, *karabo.bound*


.. code-block:: python

    from karabo.middlelayer_api.tests.eventloop import DeviceTest, async_tst
    # Imports moved, please use
    from karabo.middlelayer.testing import DeviceTest, async_tst


2.
Since March 2021, the `Injectable` class is not required anymore in device code
and has been deprecated. Finally, from 2.19.X onwards, the class is removed from karabo.


.. code-block:: python

    from karabo.middlelayer_api.injectable import Injectable

    class GATTPhysicalUnit(Injectable, Device):
        ...

    # Injectable is not required anymore and will throw, remove import and use

    class GATTPhysicalUnit(Device):
        ...


3.
Dependency upgrade: yaml -> use `yaml.safe_load` instead of `yaml.load`


.. code-block:: python

    # The following line will throw, yaml.load requires a kwarg `loader`
    data = yaml.load(file.read())

    # use
    data = yaml.safe_load(file.read())


4.
C++ Boost placeholders (e.g. ::_1) need to be explicitly declared, otherwise code is not compiling
To make the code working again, please add on top of the file

.. code-block:: C++

    using boost::placeholders::_1;
    using boost::placeholders::_2;

5.
`ImageData` *header* functionality has been **removed** from the Framework for both C++ and Bound.
Hence, code containing this functionality will throw or prevent compilation.


6.
`DetectorGeometry` has been removed from C++ and Bound due to non-use in operation. An import
will throw an exception.

7.
Use the `central CI template` (https://git.xfel.eu/Karabo/gitlabci)
C++ example: https://git.xfel.eu/karaboDevices/scanlabGalvo/-/merge_requests/37/diffs
Python example: https://git.xfel.eu/karaboDevices/vacuumSection/-/merge_requests/27/diffs

Please be aware that the central CI template utilizes pytest instead of nosetests. If your test file lacks the prefix 'test_', it will not be able to test the device. To resolve this issue, kindly rename your test files to include 'test_' in the name. For example, you can rename 'TestBeckhoffAssistant.py' to 'test_beckhoff_assistant.py'.
