***************************
What's New in Karabo 2.18.0
***************************

Release date was the **13.06.2023**. This release is the first tailored open source
release. The dependency system has been changed and now makes use of conan center and the python package index PyPi.
Additionally, all h5 related code has been removed from the software framework.

Hence, this release is NOT for production, but **experimental** and a development release.


Summary â€“ Release highlights
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- **A new dependency system based on conan and pip.**


Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

- C++/Bound: h5 related code has been removed from the Karabo Framework.
- C++/Bound: If an NDArray inside a Hash that is sent via an output channel
  contains data that is touched after Device.writeChannel (or
  OutputChannel.update), the safeNDArray flag of these methods now explicitly
  must be set to false to guarantee data integrity.
  Similarly the copyAllData flag of OutputChannel.write has changed to false.
  Note this will again change in future releases:
  The default of the safeNDArray flag will change back to false whereas the
  copyAllData flag will be unused and write behave always as if the flag would
  be false.
