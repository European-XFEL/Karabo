**************************
What's New in Karabo 2.3.0
**************************


The **most relevant improvements** and fixes are:

- GUI: The Graphical user interface becomes quicker and more user-friendly, e.g. device-provided scenes can be retrieved via double-click from the navigation- and project panel.
- GUI: The scene toolbars of the SA1, SA2 and SA3 topics are coloured
- GUI: Trendlines can be derived by double-click on a supported property widget in the scene or a property in the configurator
- GUI: The **Karabo Cinema** allows to quickly load a scene from command line
- GUI: First steps of configuration retrieval from the dataloggers (Only works with online devices)
- GUI: Mandatory check on Nodes for configurator visualization !3121


- ikarabo: Gets a Macro API with functions like *showAlarms* and *showInterlocks* to show the respective alarm service information.
- ikarabo: Devices can have interfaces and can be found via *listMotors*, *listCameras*, *listMultiAxisMotors*, *listTriggers* and *listProcessors*
- *findDevices* and *findServers* are added and accept a matchPattern (string) to look for in the systemtopology
- ikarabo: The overview of clients can be viewed with *getClients*
- ikarabo: *getConfigurationFromPast* and *getSchemaFromPast* have been added to retrieve old configuration and schemas by providing a *timepoint*
- ikarabo: The systemTopology can be provided with *getTopology* and the global *devices* was removed


- MDL: The middlelayer API is significantly enhanced and uses now declared data types (casted as **numpy data types**)
- MDL: The middle layer servers receive broadcasting messages only once, giving them a big performance and stability boost
- MDL: The error messages (logs) have been adjusted so that e.g. the Python error stacktrace will be visible in the GUI
- MDL: An important bug when overwriting properties was fixed (if a setter function was used in a decorator)
- MDL: The new asynchronous **Python 3.6.6** syntax is officially supported
- MDL: Several improvements to pipelining proxies including reconnect
- MDL: Standard functions provided to load and save to XML (*saveToFile*, *loadFromFile*)
- MDL: Much faster access to entries of the karabo data container Hash: up to a factor of 100
- MDL: The *DeviceNode* can accept a timeout parameter *timeout* to throw an error message if the proxy cannot be established within this time frame


- C++/bound: In the bound/C++ framework the way to establish pipeline connections has been refactored to avoid situations where a connection could not be established
- C++/bound: Ensure message ordering by chaining message execution. This means even more than in the past that slot calls must not take long!
- C++: It is recommended to use the DeviceClient for pipeline management


.. note::

    The Python version has been finally updated to **3.6.6**!


.. note::

    The getConfigurationFromPast in ikarabo only returns a configuration!
