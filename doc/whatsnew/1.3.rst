  What's New in Karabo 1.3
****************************

This chapter explains the new features in Karabo 1.3. The final release of 
Karabo 1.3 is scheduled for March 2015. 


Fixes in Karabo 1.3.11
=======================

Fixed Version::getPathToVersionFile()
- did not respect KARABO environment variable before
- add also Version::getPathToKaraboInstallation() to be uses elsewhere

Improve error reporting (P2P). Make a check in destructors to protect us from segfault

Fixed possible race condition in retrieving device configuration

Fixed bugs in InputChannel/OutputChannel python binding: attempt to call python handlers without acquiring the GIL. Solution to use C++ proxy handlers that call python handlers in turn, but under the GIL protection

Fixes to make procedure, especially for building via command line.
- now the makefile parts generated by NetBeans are used on the command line, even if they have come into live via a svn/git checkout
- take care that Karabo is built if building Karathon
- the update of a 'Release' makefile (generated by NetBeans) was missing in the repository

Fixed a resource leak regarding sockets

Fix problem when restarting dataLoggerManagerServer and dataLoggerServer simultaneously. Support starting these servers in any order and restarting any of them if needed. At restarting the run should be stopped.

Fixed history retrieval problem by on the fly index building in the data logger: Whenever the history of a property is asked the first time, the index building is triggered in the background.
 

New "features" in Karabo 1.3.11
===============================

As an exception to the rule, this patch level increase comes with an additionally feature as a kind of pre-release:

* Karabo now has a TABLE_ELEMENT that allows devices to posses a table-like property. Variable number of fields with different field types can be used. 
  Internally the table is represented as an array of Hashes, with each Hash representing an individual row.
