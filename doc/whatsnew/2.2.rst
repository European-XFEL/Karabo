What's New in Karabo 2.2.6
**************************

Hotfix release for MDL and cpp DeviceClient. Previously, the middlelayer devices
described their schema with vectors using minSize and maxSize wrong. This is
corrected here.
The DeviceNode bug occurs when multiple device nodes are used in a device,
giving an exception.
The input channels created by DeviceClient, e.g. as happening in DOOCS, will
get an instance id to not confuse connected outputchannels.

Detailed Merge-Log
==================

Middlelayer Core
++++++++++++++++
- MDL: Fix current hash setting in DeviceNode !2989
- MDL: Fix attribute type description in schema !2963

cpp/bound Core
++++++++++++++
- C++: Give and id to input channels created by DeviceClient !2981


**************************
What's New in Karabo 2.2.5
**************************

Hotfix release regarding **cpp pipelining** and **GUI fixes** for trashed projects.
In summary, the trashing design follows now in the direction of the meta data
catalogue, where one can declare a RUN quality. The trashing attribute is used
in exactly the same transparent way. Trashing should be exceptional!

- **Save as** is **NOT** possible anymore
- GUI server can refuse old clients to enforce GUI client version
- Trashing a project will not close the project
- Trashing from 'Load Dialog' is not possible anymore
- The operator is allowed to load trashed project, it might still contain valid data
- Trashed projects will appear in pink in the project view and operator gets a notify dialog (2.2.4.4)

The datalogger instantiation is slowed down, to make the establish signal
connection reliably and the cpp pipelining was corrected for empty detector data.

Hotfix release regarding GUI fixes for trashed projects. A loaded trashed project
will appear in **pink** color and the operator will get a pop-up.
Scene links are blindly copied if only the subproject is 'saved as ..' and
the uuid's are shown in tooltip fashion for projects and scenes.

In addition, the focus behavior in the Configurator was corrected.

Summary
=======

The **most relevant improvements** and fixes are:

ikarabo enhancements
++++++++++++++++++++
- getServers() and getDevices() account for visibility (!2761, !2774)
- Pretty Print output (!2766)
- Add getSchema and getConfiguration (!2707, !2720)

Karabo Core
+++++++++++
- MDL: Harmonize device interface with C++/bound - slotClearLock, lastCommand, process id, input channel EndOfStream handler (!2799, !2744 !2845, !2742)
- MDL: Pipelines automatically reconnect (!2855, !2867)
- MDL: Full trainID integration (!2694)
- C++, bound: Speed up NDArray (de-) serialization for pipelines processing (!2725, !2783, !2775)
- C++, bound: Fix runtime attribute setting for reconfigurable parameters (!2717, !2726)
- C++, bound: Do not ignore empty keys in Hash (!2706)
- C++, bound: Hash printing suppresses content of long vectors/NDArrays (!2698, !2739)
- Add State.PROCESSING to Karabo (!2806)
- Add binning information to ImageData (!2691)
- Bound: Fix setting of timestamp (!2722)

Karabo GUI
++++++++++
- GUI: Fix that sometimes project data was stored in wrong domain (!2757)
- Flickering alarms do not block GUI anymore (!2772)
- GUI: Implement macro code editor with line numbers and highlight (!2779)
- GUI: Pop-up for properties in the configurator can be freezed to allow copy/paste from it (!2850)
- GUI: Clean-up icons, add new ones (!2751, !2750,!2749, !2718)
- GUI: Easier precision placement of scene items (!2745, !2723)
- GUI: Display YUV images (!2661)


Empty Key Handling of Hash
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Empty strings are now valid keys of a `Hash`.

Before, a completely empty path (`aHash.set("", something)`) let to a crash and
empty keys as part of a path with sub-keys were simply ignored.
That means that `aHash.set("a..b.", something)` had the same effect as
`aHash.set("a.b", something)`, i.e. a path with the two sub-keys `a` and `b`,
whereas in Karabo 2.2.4 the path of the former actually differs and has four
sub-keys of which two are empty keys.

What's New in Karabo 2.2

C++ and Bound Python
======================

Standalone DeviceClient
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
The constructors to create a standalone `DeviceClient` do not take anymore
arguments about the broker connection. They always use the default behaviour.

Instead, one can now specify the instanceId of the `DeviceClient` object
instead of getting a default one generated: `DeviceClient(instanceId)`.
In fact, that is the recommended
way since otherwise a program that crashes after creating a standalone
`DeviceClient` may leave remnants in the system, even if restarted.

These remnants are useless signal subscriptions since the restarted program
has a new instanceId. They can potentially slow down the broker and every
recipient of the emitted signals. If restarted with the same id as before
(as usually is done with devices and servers), these remnants are cleaned.
