**************************
What's New in Karabo 2.4.2
**************************

The hotfix release for devices interacting with our the doocs library. Previously,
the filtered Schema would cause an exception due to table elements.

- C++/Bound: Fix bug in handling TableElement by HashFilter class !3503


**************************
What's New in Karabo 2.4.1
**************************

The hotfix release for Karabo pipelining includes many stabilization fixes and a new feature to visualize
pipeline connections in output channels with a table element.

- fix bound Python device client ('bad weak_ptr' => no ageing),
- fix bound Python SignalSlotable::connect not releasing global interpreter lock (fixes pipeline connection problems)
- feature: output channel connections table (all APIs)
- input channel id includes channel name (in addition to device id)
- fix deduction of "remoteness" of remote input channels with same process id
- fix "queue" behaviour of pipelines wrt. copying data
- performance fix when pipelines have to copy data (i.e. "queue" or local [same process] receiver)

**************************
What's New in Karabo 2.4.0
**************************


The **most relevant improvements**, fixes and changes are:

- GUI: Older GUI clients are not compatible with GUI servers of Karabo 2.4.0:
  They will not receive pipeline data. Request - reply protocol!
- GUI: Server forwards timestamp for pipeline data. The timestamp for images is now correct.
- GUI: Addition of Weblink widget (in scene tools)
- GUI: Addition of Wheelbox widget
- GUI: Addition of editable options box widget
- GUI: Addition of timestamp widget
- GUI: Cinema enhancements with direct connect, username and multiple scenes
- GUI: No interpolation in image widgets by default
- GUI: More scene items are state aware
- GUI: Align fonts and style across different OS
- GUI: Segmentation fault fixes in Tablelement and AlarmPanel
- GUI: More drag & drop functionality from project panel: Scenes can be dragged on scenes
- GUI: Implementation of the first device topology (domain - type - member)
- GUI: Print support for each panel
- GUI: Tooltips of last received data for image widgets
- GUI: Enable of wheeling of widgets into the Karabo GUI - Extensions
- MDL: Proxy (e.g. in ikarabo) uses now meta data timestamp for pipeline data.
- MDL: Autostart implemented in device server to enable core devices startup
- Core Devices: The ProjectManager is now a MDL device!
- Core Devices: GUI Server now caches and forwards logs with loglevel INFO
- C++: Several pipeline improvements and stabilization/fixes to race conditions
- C++/bound: Several pipeline and Tcp communication improvements/stabilizations including fixes to race conditions and indirect memory ("chunk") leakage
- C++/bound: Fixes to uuid handling for asynchronous slot replies and for the request(..).receive[Async](..) patterns
- C++: DataLoggers publish when last data arrived

Minor **backward incompatibilities**:

- Invalid schema elements will not be ignored anymore, but trigger a LogicException.
  The specific cases are a leaf added to a non-existing node, a leaf where the
  parent is not node, and a leaf added to a list of nodes.

- **OLD GUI Clients** (2.3.1) lack a new server protocol message and will not work with Karabo 2.4.0
