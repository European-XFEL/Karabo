  What's New in Karabo 1.4
****************************

This chapter explains the new features in Karabo 1.4.


New Features
============

Device Ids with Slashes
-----------------------

Since release 1.4.0, device ids are allowed to contain slashes ('/') to support the 
European XFEL naming convention.

To allow that, the file names used for data logging had to be changed in a non-backward
compatible way. If an existing installation is upgraded from 1.3.X to 1.4.0 or beyond,
manual intervention is needed to keep the logged data history accessible. For that purpose
a script is provided in $KARABO/bin: ``convertKaraboHistoryFrom13X.sh``.
It has to be run once on the host of the data logger server(s). Consult the ``--help``
option of the script for further details.
