Change of behaviour
+++++++++++++++++++

- GUI: By default the property alarm color for devices in the `Configurator` is now disabled. This is intended as the
  `Configurator` can only evaluate static alarms defined by the device schema. To view property specific alarms, please use the alarm panel.
  To turn this feature back on, please use the *Application Configuration dialog** accessible via the menu bar of the client.
- GUI: Device scene links cannot be created from the device property `availableScenes` anymore. They become a scene tool widget and
  have to be created from the scene panel toolbar or via dragging a device onto a scene.
  Device scene links don't trigger itself monitoring of a device.
- MDL: Log-events do not generate a broker message anymore. For logging messages, please retrieve the last log messages on demand via the karabo gui client
       interface or view the local log file.
