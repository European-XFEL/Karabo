****************************
What's New in Karabo 2.10.0
****************************

The **most relevant improvements**, fixes and changes are:

- C++/bound: The legacy point-to-point shortcut for broker type communication
  has been removed, including the configuration parameters
  GuiServerDevice.p2pDevices and DataLoggerManager.useP2p and DataLogger.useP2p
  that were used to switch the feature (partially) on.

- MDL: Every `requiredAccessLevel` which will be at least `AccessLevel.USER` for **reconfigurable** parameters
  if not explicitly specified!

- MDL: The eventloop can be configured and set to ``uvloop`` via an environemnt variable. Please set ``KARABO_UVLOOP``
  before starting the device server to use ``uvloop`` instead of native ``asyncio``.

  - For now, MDL servers started with ``uvloop`` cannot start devices from ``bound`` python.

- MDL: Outputchannel can write end of stream token with coroutine `writeEndOfStream`.

- MDL: A new karabo descriptor is introduced, the ``RegexString``. A string descriptor which validatas against regex pattern.

- Core Devices: The ``DaemonManager`` device has been moved to the Framework.

- Core Devices: A new Framework device has been created, the ``ConfigurationManager``.

- Pipelines: The available options of the onSlowness parameter that defines how an output channel should react
  if a connected input channel is not yet ready to receive more data, have changed: The non-functional throw has been
  removed and a new option queueDrop has been introduced. The default has changed from wait to **drop**.
  The ``compression`` key has been removed.

- All API: The `visibility` of devices cannot be configured on runtime anymore.

- All API: The core devices get a common place with deviceId definitions. In the future, these deviceIds must be used:
  KARABO_ALARM_SERVICE = "Karabo_AlarmService"
  KARABO_CONFIG_MANAGER = "KaraboConfigurationManager"
  KARABO_DAEMON_MANAGER = "KaraboDaemonManager"
  KARABO_PROJECT_MANAGER = "KaraboProjectManager"

- GUI: The Karabo GUI is shipped now with open license fonts: Source Sans Pro, Source Serif Pro, Source Code Pro. **All other fonts won't be offered anymore.**

- GUI: The grid layout has been deprecated. It can be still read and written, but won't be offered anymore on grouping.

- GUI: The DoubleWheelEdit controller has been deprecated.

- GUI: The Slider widget has been deprecated.
