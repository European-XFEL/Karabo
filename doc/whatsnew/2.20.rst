***************************
What's New in Karabo 2.20.0
***************************

Release date will be about spring 2024.


Summary â€“ Release highlights
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Bound Python API got a new foundation: The binding code to make Karabo C++
features available in Python has been completely rewritten using the modern
and maintained `pybind11` library.
The Bound interface is basically unchanged. Exceptions are listed
among the breaking changes below.

The C++ API now requires a C++ 17 compliant compiler. A breaking change to
the interface of `karabo::util::StringTools` resulted from the migration to
C++ 17 and is documented below.


Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

C++ API
===========
- *OverwriteElement* got more strict: Before it was silently ignoring cases
  like overwriting a non-existing key or inconsistencies between options and
  default values. Now it throws.

Bound API
===========

- The *DeviceClient.registerPropertyMonitor* function does not take the
  *userData* argument anymore and thus the passed *callbackFunction* will not
  receive that as argument anymore, either.
  Make use of *functools.partial* for the callback instead.
- The *bound.api* `VectorString` has been removed. Use a python `list` instead.

Dependency Updates
++++++++++++++++++

This release contains a major Python update to **3.11** (was 3.8).


Detailed Merge-Log
++++++++++++++++++


MDL/Native core
===============


Bound/cpp core
==============

- The **StringTools::fromString** template overload that returns a sorted container
with the strings contained in an input string has been renamed to
**StringTools::fromStringToSortedCont**. The change comes from a modification
in the way a C++ compiler matches template template arguments with defaults introduced
by C++ 17. More details are provided by comments in **StringTools.hh**.
