***************************
What's New in Karabo 2.20.0
***************************

Release date will be about spring 2024.


Summary â€“ Release highlights
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Bound Python API got a new foundation: The binding code to make Karabo C++
features available in Python has been completely rewritten using the modern
and maintained `pybind11` library.
The Bound interface is basically unchanged. Exceptions are listed
among the breaking changes below.


Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

Bound API
===========

- The *DeviceClient.registerPropertyMonitor* function does not take the
  *userData* argument anymore and thus the passed *callbackFunction* will not
  receive that as argument anymore, either.
  Make use of *functools.partial* for the callback instead.


Change of behaviour
