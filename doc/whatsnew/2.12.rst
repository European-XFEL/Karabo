Summary â€“ Release highlights

- GUI: Offline project devices are now loaded lazily giving a significant project loading boost

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

- MDL: DeviceNodes cannot have *properties* and *commands* anymore
- MDL: Tables validate now their minSize and maxSize attribute
- C++: The typedef for ``uint64`` has been removed from `karabo/util/karaboDll.hh` (since incompatible with opencv library headers).

Change of behaviour
+++++++++++++++++++

- Since 2.12.0, slots of Bound Python devices called with fewer arguments than
  expected return an error reply to the caller. Before 2.12.0, the slot function
  was called anyway, using ``None`` for the missing arguments.

- MDL: Macros started from command line are now declared as **clients** in the instanceInfo and will therefore not appear in the **SystemTopology** of the GUI
