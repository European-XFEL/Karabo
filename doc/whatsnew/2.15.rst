***************************
What's New in Karabo 2.15.0
***************************

- GUI: The client will prevent adding "backbone" devices to projects. Pre-existing Devices will not be modified.
- GUI: The alarm columns in the Navigation and Project Panel are now by default hidden.
  The reason is that extra alarms visualization is performance draining. The visibility can be toggled
  on in the `Application Configuration` dialog of the menu bar. Changes in this configuration
  will be active after application restart. This information is now logged by the GUI server.
  The `AlarmPanel` now have a ``deviceId`` search option, please consider using this instead.
