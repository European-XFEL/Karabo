***************************
What's New in Karabo 2.15.0
***************************

This section shows the new features in Karabo 2.15.0, compared to 2.14.0.
The use of this version of the GUI is encouraged without the need of upgrading the Karabo Servers.
This release is **backwards compatible** until version **2.11**.

This Karabo release contains a ``nympy`` dependency update: **1.22.3**

Summary â€“ Release highlights
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- GuiServer: The pipeline reconnection bug preventing image updates in the graphical user interface was fixed.
- GUI: HistoricText Widget for historic string data available on double-click in Configurator and Scene.
- GUI: Optional Search in Configurator Panel added
- GUI: Rework of Logging and Alarm Panel for performance and filtering options
- GUI: TableStringButton added to the framework for device scene links and urls
- GUI: In general there are major performance improvements for the table widgets (up to >10),
  Configurator (more than 2), image updates and Device/Schema Building (around a factor of 2).
- GUI: Macro Editor handling: Indent, Unindent on key events and search / replace bar added to code editor.
- MDL: Both InputChannel and OutputChannel are supported in Nodes
- MDL: Proxies created with getDevice (e.g. DeviceNode) retrieve a configuration only once
- MDL: Shutdown of devices and servers is hardened against device hanging or faulty jupyter kernel shutdown. A device server will always
  terminate the process at the end.
- MDL: *printHistory* and *getTimeInfo* added to CLI commands.
- MDL: Full pytest support and test template including pytest dependencies for asyncio, timeout, mock, and subtest.
- MDL: A new Hash view showing the data type for each value and a table for table values was implemented
- MDL: Better table value handling, e.g. Hashes can be set to single cells, filtering options with `TableValue.where_value`.
- C++: DeviceClient support for synchronous execution of slot with args
- Core Devices: New DaemonManager using the TableBoolButton interface with Start/Restart and Stop button
- Core Devices: Webaggregator now uses the unmangled karabo service name. This means that servers appear with their
  correct serverId in the service manager table.

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++


Change of behaviour
+++++++++++++++++++

- C++/Bound: Both C++ and Bound devices will shutdown if they experience an exception in their initialization method, to synchronize with MDL.
- MDL: Default values of vector properties are now fully casted to their numpy dtype. Before the first element
  was considered only for simple types (int, float). Now 64 bit values are possible as well.

.. code-block:: python

    int32 = VectorInt32(
        defaultValue=[1, 2, 3])

    int32.descriptor.defaultValue -> [np.int32(1), np.int32(2), np.int32(3)]

- MDL: Using i-operators in KaraboValues will set the timestamp to `None`.
  This means that in a `Device` a new timestamp is generated afterwards.

.. code-block:: python

    int32 = Int32(
        defaultValue=1)

    def increase(self):
        self.int32 += 1  # This will provide a new timestamp on device property!

- GUI: A few widgets have been removed: AnalogWidget, IconSet and FileIn/Out controllers.
- GUI: The Icon Widget can handle string as replacement for IconSet
- GUI: The client will prevent adding "backbone" devices to projects. Pre-existing Devices will not be modified.
- GUI: The alarm columns in the Navigation and Project Panel are now by default hidden.
  The reason is that extra alarms visualization is performance draining. The visibility can be toggled
  on in the `Application Configuration` dialog of the menu bar. Changes in this configuration
  will be active after application restart. This information is now logged by the GUI server.
  The `AlarmPanel` now have a ``deviceId`` search option, please consider using this instead.
