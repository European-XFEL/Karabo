External Dependency Management in Karabo
========================================

The Karabo Framework depends on a large number of third party packages.
The karabo C++ library dependencies are managed using the conan open
source package manager. This automatically provides things like Python,
boost, AMQP, etc.

Because building these dependencies has become a time consuming and sensitive
process, they are now being managed by an automated system. Together with the
CI (continuous integration) features of GitLab, the dependencies are
automatically built and cached whenever one or more of those
dependencies changes.


Installing the Dependencies into a Clean Source Tree
----------------------------------------------------

After cloning the framework from git, or doing a clean rebuild, the external
dependencies should first be installed. This is handled automatically by the
``auto_build_all.sh`` script.

The already-built dependencies will be downloaded from the public conan
repository when available. If pre-built binaries are not available, then the
source code will be download and compiled locally according to the script
in the conanfile.py of the dependency package.


Mechanism for Determining Correct Dependencies to Install
---------------------------------------------------------

The conan package manager enables building the karabo framework with a
deterministic build environment. All of the build options, compiler
and host system settings are used to compute a package ID for the dependency.
The package ID is a unique identifier that conan uses to determine package
compatibility with a host system and other dependencies.

If you are interested in a more detailed explanation of how this works, you
can read more about it at blog.conan.io:

https://blog.conan.io/2019/09/27/package-id-modes.html


Adding/Removing/Updating a Dependency
-------------------------------------

To add, remove, or update a dependency in Karabo, create a new feature branch
and make your changes. Build and install the dependency (or dependencies)
that you are currently concerned with.

Building all of Karabo is explained in :ref:`installation/sources`. But if you
only want to know how to build a single extern. Here is the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd extern
    ./build.sh <platform-directory> externPackageName

``<platform-directory>`` is usually something like ``GNU-Linux-x86``.
It's the directory where all built externs are staged before
being copied into a karabo build directory.

Note that dependencies which include executable binaries (programs or shared
libraries) will need to have their ``RUNPATH`` metadata set so that runtime
linking works appropriately. This is handled by the ``extern/relocate_deps.sh``
script, and should be made there when adding/removing/updating dependencies.

In order to test the built result, you can create a feature branch with name
format of ``deps-mr-<package>`` and push it to the framework repository. The
CI runner will pick up this branch and create the a new dependency package at
http://exflctrl01.desy.de/karabo/karaboDevelopmentDeps

Once the dependency package is created, you can try verify it by clean building
the framework locally using this package:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./auto_build_all.sh Clean-All
    ./auto_build_all.sh Debug --pyDevelop

This will build the framework using the updated dependency packages created
from your feature branch. Once finished, you can try to use the framework to
verify if the new/updated pakcage plays nicely with the framework.

Once you are reasonably sure that everything works, open a merge request for
the branch. After the merge request is approved and merged into the master
branch, add a tag to the merge commit:

.. code-block:: bash

    git log  # to find the commit hash for the merge commit
    git tag deps-<name> <commit hash>  # See below for naming convention
    git push origin --tags

This will cause an automated build to begin and rebuild the dependencies. If
this build fails, then shame on you. You should be more careful when working
with the dependencies. You'll need to fix the problem with a new merge
request and tag. It's not the end of the world, of course, but it might
cause grief for anyone who performs a clean rebuild before you've fixed the
master branch.


The Naming Convention for Dependency tags
-----------------------------------------

All dependency tags need to begin with "deps-". This is hardcoded into the
build infrastructure. The rest is only defined by convention.

The basic format is: ``deps-<action>-<package>``

``<action>`` is one of the following: add, update, remove

``<package>`` is the principle package which is being changed. The fact that
multiple packages are perhaps being modified is not terribly important. It is
also a good idea to add a little bit of version information after the package
name for disambiguation. As the number of "deps-" tags grows, some packages will
likely appear more than once (eg. deps-update-boostNNN or deps-update-numpy)


Current collection of dependencies
----------------------------------

Karabo is currently shipped with the a tree dependencies that enables
development directly from the distributed platform:

In order to disentangle the dependencies' structure, it is convenient to split the structure as follow:
The graph below represents the karabo libraries (please note that the graph below represents the goal
of a refactoring that is in progress):

.. digraph:: karabo_libraries

    "karathon" -> "karabo-cpp"
    "karabogui" -> "karabo.common"
    "karabogui" -> "karabo.native"
    "karabo.middlelayer" -> "karabo.native"
    "karabo.middlelayer" -> "karabo.common"
    "karabo.middlelayer_devices" -> "karabo.middlelayer"
    "karabo.middlelayer_devices" -> "karabo.project_db"
    "karabo.bound" -> "karabo.common"
    "karabo.bound" -> "karathon"
    "karabo.bound_devices" -> "karabo.project_db"
    "karabo.bound_devices" -> "karabo.bound"

Here are the dependencies of the ``karabo-cpp`` python module:

.. digraph:: karabocpp_dependencies

    "boost" -> "libxslt"
    "libxml2" -> "bzip2"
    "libxslt" -> "bzip2"
    "amqpcpp" -> "libev"

Here are the dependencies of the ``karabo.common`` python module:

.. digraph:: karabocommon_dependencies

    "karabo.common" -> "traits"

Here are the dependencies of the ``karabo.native`` python sub-module:

	"python-dateutil" -> "six"

Here are the dependencies of the ``karabo.project_db`` python sub-module:

.. digraph:: karaboprojectdb_dependencies

	"karabo.project_db" -> "eulexistdb"
	"karabo.project_db" -> "psutil"

	"requests" -> "idna"
	"requests" -> "urllib3"
	"requests" -> "certify"

Here are the dependencies of the ``karabo.middlelayer`` python sub-module, for the sake of clarity,
the ``ipython``, ``numpy`` and ``jupyter_client`` modules are not expanded in their dependencies:

    "karabo.middlelayer" -> "jupyter_client"
    "aiormq" -> "pamqp"
    "aiormq" -> "yarl"
    "yarl" -> "multidict"

Here are the dependencies of the ``karabogui`` python sub-module, for the sake of clarity,
the ``ipython``, ``numpy`` and ``jupyter_client`` modules are not expanded in their dependencies:

	"karabogui" -> "karabo.common"

Remarks on miniconda3 Windows CI
================================

Our release process for Windows is now done on a shared Windows 10 runner.
This runner was configured manually by means of installing `miniconda3`, `plink`
and `cwrsync` on our home folder (*C:\Users\xkarabo*) and are all added on `xkarabo`
path. Currently the GitLab CI logs in as a system user, so we have to
manually add these environment variables each time the job is executed
(see **.gitlab-ci.yaml**). Also, `cwrsync's ssh` tool needs the **HOME** variable
set to be %USERPROFILE%.

Also, for the Windows CI as we don't have an easy-to-use tool like `sshpass`
we have created an RSA key and added it to our linux server (*exflctrl01*). The
key on Windows is located on `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\win-cwrsync`.

Code used for building the recipe
---------------------------------

Our building process has three steps:

The first step for the release is to create (solve) the environment based on our
`environment.devenv.file`. This environment is used to generate our recipe's
`meta.yaml` based on a template called `meta_base.yaml` using a very well known
code generator called `cogapp`. After this file is generated, we can delegate
the build process to `conda-build`. When successful, we will have our package
inside `<conda_directory>/conda-bld/<platform>/`.

After the karabogui package is built, we also need to populate our mirror channel based on
the package's dependencies. For this we developed a script called
`create_mirror_channels.py` which decides which packages to download using the
`conda-mirror` tool. The advantage to have a mirror is that the deployment is much
faster and we have the safety of having our internal channel.

Possible Issues
===============

Differently from our Linux CI, the Windows CI is not started fresh at each run,
so it's possible that some issues arise during the release process. We try to
mitigate most of them by some cleaning process on `ci/miniconda/build.cmd`.

Some errors that were met were:


`Not a conda environment: <environment path>`
---------------------------------------------

The environment got corrupted somehow. Fix it by removing it manually:

    conda remove -n <environment_name> --all --yes

    or

    conda env remove -n <environment_name> --all

Package conflicts on test phase
-------------------------------

Usually it's an error like the following

    Found conflicts! Looking for incompatible packages.
    This can take several minutes.  Press CTRL-C to abort.
    failed

    Package libtiff conflicts for:
    pyqtgraph==0.11.0=py_1 -> pyqt -> qt=5.6 -> libtiff=4.0
    karabogui==2.7.0a5=py36_0 -> pillow==6.2.1=py36h5fcff3f_1 -> libtiff[version='>=4.1.0,<5.0a0']
    karabogui==2.7.0a5=py36_0 -> libtiff==4.1.0=h21b02b4_1
    libtiff==4.1.0=h21b02b4_1
    Package pygments conflicts for:
    karabogui==2.7.0a5=py36_0 -> pygments[version='2.4.2|2.5.0',build=py_0]
    karabogui==2.7.0a5=py36_0 -> ipython==7.2.0=py36h39e3cac_1000 -> pygments
    qtconsole==4.6.0=py_0 -> pygments
    ipykernel==5.1.3=py36h5ca1d4c_0 -> ipython[version='>=5.0'] -> pygments
    ipython==7.2.0=py36h39e3cac_1000 -> jedi[version='>=0.10']]


Either this means:

* An actual conflicting of dependencies
* One of the packages are not available on the desired platform
* A dirty conda build cache

On our scenario, as we always solve the environment before the build (in order
to decide which packages we use), the first two options are not viable. By cleaning
the conda build cache it usually works:

    conda build purge-all

If it doesn't, try cleaning everything in conda:

    conda clean --all --yes

If it doesn't, it might be a bug generated by an update on the conda package.
Try downgrading it:

    conda install -n base conda=<lower_version>

Remarks on Licensing
====================

For the Karabo Framework, excluding the GUI, we plan to use a Mozilla Public License
version 2.0 , which foresees as weak form of copy-left.

for more information:
https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/FAQ/

The GUI would be released initially as GPLv3, which is required by the PyQt5
library the GUI uses.
A future more permissive license is possible, but would require factoring out
the GPLv3 dependency, which we do not deem necessary as of now.

A note on the General Public License
------------------------------------

Licensing the framework with stricter copy-left licenses like the General Public
License (GPL) is not possible due to conflicts between the software license of
some of the dependencies used. The OpenMQ C library is dual licensed with the
Eclipse Public License version 2.0 (EPL-2.0) and the GPL version 2.0 (GPL-2.0).
GPL-2.0 is in conflict with the Apache Software License version 2 (Apache-2.0)
that is used by multiple libraries and this precludes
the use of GPL-2.0 and the strict definition of the GPL included in OpenMQ precludes
the use of other GPL versions.

For more information regarding the EPL-2.0 dual licensing:
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/faq.php

License for the Karabo GUI
--------------------------

The Karabo GUI depends from a library that has a strong copyleft license.
The PyQT5 graphical user interface library is licensed under GPLv3 or Commercial.
This limits the licenses usable for the Karabo GUI to GPLv3.

The Karabo GUI is however currently using an abstraction layer that will allow
the use of a less strictly licensed library and if the need arises or we wish to,
the Karabo GUI code could be relicensed using a more permissive license.

A note regarding Karabo Plugins (Devices)
-----------------------------------------

The Mozilla Public License (MPL) extends to all files containing code licensed
under the MPL. As a consequence of this, all code using plugins can be licensed
and released with a license of the choice of the authors as long as the distribution
of such code and binaries complies with the license of Karabo and its dependencies.
