Karabo is the name of European XFEL GmbH's homogenoeus software
framework.

It essentially is a framework allowing to build plug-able distributed
(networked) applications that can be remotely controlled. 
Karabo will be used for control and DAQ (i.e. as `SCADA
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA>`_ system) but also for
data-management, and data analysis aspects.
