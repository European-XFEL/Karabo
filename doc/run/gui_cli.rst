Starting the GUI
================

Having Karabo installed properly type::

  karabo-gui

Instructions of how to use the GUI can be found :ref:`here <concepts-gui>`.

If you log into the correct GUI server, you will be immediately able to view and
control (given your access persmissions allow it) devices that are currently
online.



Starting a Command Line
=======================

Having Karabo installed properly type::

  karabo-cli

or::

  ikarabo

depending on what you want. Both commands provide a Python command line,
but with slightly different syntax.

Using the command line interface is described :ref:`here <concepts-ikarabo>`.
