Starting the GUI
================

Having Karabo installed properly type::

  karabo-gui

Instructions of how to use the GUI can be found :ref:`here <concepts-gui>`.

If you log into the correct GUI server, you will be immediately able to view and
control (given your access persmissions allow it) devices that are currently
online.



Starting a Command Line
=======================

Having Karabo installed properly type::

  ikarabo

Using the command line interface is described :ref:`here <concepts-ikarabo>`.


For Karabo framework developers another command line interface exists::

  karabo-cli

This command line is slightly different in API and completely differs in 
the way it is implemented (namely through using the C++ code under the hood).
