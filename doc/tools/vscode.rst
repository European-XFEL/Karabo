************************
Getting Started - VSCode
************************

This guide provides instructions on how to setup VSCode for C++
development work on the Karabo Framework or on a Karabo C++ Device. The setup
instructions in here are for Ubuntu versions 18 and 20 - they should work
with few modifications for other Linux distributions supported by Karabo.


1. Installation Steps
=====================

1.1. Install VSCode
-------------------

To install VSCode, please follow the instructions at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux.

For Ubuntu, both the `snap` and the `apt` based installation methods work.

1.2. Install VSCode Extensions
------------------------------

Open VSCode, and install the following extensions:

* C/C++ from Microsoft - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools.
* CMake Tools from Microsoft - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools.

The following additional extensions are not required, just recommended:

* CMake from twxs - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=twxs.cmake.
* Git Lens - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens.


1.3. Configure GDB Pretty printing
----------------------------------

*This step may not be needed on your system*. Please test your VSCode with a simple
C++ program that has a `std::string`, a `std::vector` or any other standard container
and see if instances of those types are properly presented in the debug view.
In particular, on a Ubuntu 20 test system no extra
configuration was needed to have `gdb` pretty-printing working.

Without pretty-printing, some C++ Standard Library like `std::string` and `std::vector`
are not printed properly in the debugging view of VSCode (the string and vector highlighted by
the yellow rectangles in the image below):

.. image:: img/vscode_no_pretty_print.png

To enable `gdb` pretty-printing, please create the file `~/.gdbinit` with the
following contents:

.. code-block:: python

   python
   import sys
   sys.path.insert(0, '/usr/share/gcc-[YOUR_GCC_MAJOR_VERSION]/python')
   from libstdcxx.v[YOUR_STDLIBCPP_MAJOR_VERSION].printers import register_libstdcxx_printers
   register_libstdcxx_printers (None)
   end


Replace [YOUR_GCC_MAJOR_VERSION] with the major version number of your `gcc`
installation, e.g. `7`,  and [YOUR_STDLIBCPP_MAJOR_VERSION] with the major
version number of you `stdlibc++` library, e.g. `6`.

For reference, this is an example of a working `~/.gdbinit` for Ubuntu 20 with
gcc 9.3.0 and gdb 9.2 installed:

.. code-block:: python

   python
   import sys
   sys.path.insert(0, '/usr/share/gcc-10/python')
   from libstdcxx.v6.printers import register_libstdcxx_printers
   register_libstdcxx_printers (None)
   end


Once `gdb` pretty-printing is configured, you should see `std::string` and other
C++ Standard Library types properly displayed in the VSCode debugging view (the
string and vector highlighted by the yellow rectangles in the image below).

.. image:: img/vscode_pretty_print.png

1.4. Clone the Karabo Framework repository
------------------------------------------

Clone the Karabo Framework git repository into your local system with::

   git clone ssh://git@git.xfel.eu:10022/Karabo/Framework.git

or with::

   git clone https://git.xfel.eu/gitlab/Karabo/Framework.git

depending on the access mode you have configured for the remote
Karabo git repository.

1.5. Install Miniconda
----------------------

The `cmake` build of the Karabo Framework library requires all the build dependencies
to be available on the building system. A good and less invasive approach to
guarantee that is to create a `Conda` environment with those dependencies installed.

Due to its smaller size, `Miniconda` is recommended over `Anaconda`. If you already
have Anaconda installed, everything should work fine as well.

To install Miniconda, please follow the instructions at
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html.


1.6. Create the Conda Environment with the Karabo Framework dependencies
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once Conda is installed, an XFEL hosted Conda channel will be needed to get
some of the Karabo Framework dependencies. To add those channels, run::

   conda config --add channels http://exflserv05.desy.de/karabo/channel

If you are outside the `DESY` network, an SSH tunnel will be needed as the host
`exflserv05.desy.de` is not public. A detailed explanation on how to add the channels
when outside the DESY network can be seem at
https://in.xfel.eu/readthedocs/docs/karabo/en/latest/installation/gui.html#remote-installations.

While validating the installation tests on a test machine, it happened that the
Miniconda installation lacked the `conda-forge` channel. As this channel is
required for some of the Karabo Framework dependencies, please make sure that
`conda-forge` is listed as an output for the following command::

   conda config --show channels

If `conda-forge` is not listed, please run the following command and list the
channels again to make sure it has been properly added::

   conda config --add channels https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge

The next step is to create a Conda environment with the packages corresponding
to the Karabo Framework dependencies installed. For that the `conda-devenv`
package is needed::

   conda install conda-devenv -c conda-forge
   conda devenv -f [KARABO_FRAMEWORK_DIR]/conda-recipes/karabo-cpp/environment.devenv.yml

Replace [KARABO_FRAMEWORK_DIR] with the path of the directory where you cloned
the `Framework` repository to in step 1.4.

1.7. Configure the VSCode CMake Extension for the Karabo Framework Project
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go to the directory where you cloned the Karabo Framework in the previous
step and create a `.vscode` sub-directory in there - do not worry, `.vscode`
is already included in the repository's `.gitignore` file. In the `.vscode`
directory, create a `settings.json` file with the following content::

   {
      "cmake.buildDirectory": "${workspaceFolder}/../[BUILD_DIR]",
      "cmake.configureSettings": {
         "CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH": "[CONDA_ENV_DIR]",
         "CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX": "[KARABO_FRAMEWORK_INSTALL_DIR]",
         "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE": "Debug",
         "BUILD_UNIT_TESTING": 1,
         "BUILD_INTEGRATION_TESTING": 1,
      }
   }

For the `cmake.buildDirectory` parameter, replace [BUILD_DIR] with any valid
directory name of your preference, e.g., "build_debug_karaboCpp". The `${workspaceFolder}`
is a reference to a variable kept by VSCode and should be left as is. The parent folder
reference is optional, but has been left in the example as a reminder on using build
directories that are outside the source tree, which is a good practice. If you opt for
using build directories inside the Framework's source tree, please make sure that
your choice for build tree is properly configured in `.gitignore`.

[CONDA_ENV_DIR] should be replaced by the directory where the Conda environment
created in the previous step is located. To get its path, issue the command::

   conda env list

The value to use for [CONDA_ENV_DIR] will be the path to the right of the
environment `karabo-cpp` on the command output.

[KARABO_FRAMEWORK_INSTALL_DIR] can be any writable location on your system. This
is where an installation tree with the artifacts resulting from the CMake build
will be installed when `cmake --build . -target install` or `make install` are
executed from the [BUILD_DIR].

An example of a configured `settings.json`::

   {
      "cmake.buildDirectory": "${workspaceFolder}/../build_debug_karaboCpp",
      "cmake.configureSettings": {
            "CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH": "/home/bob/miniconda3/envs/karabo-cpp",
            "CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX": "${workspaceFolder}/../install_framework",
            "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE": "Debug",
            "BUILD_UNIT_TESTING": 1,
            "BUILD_INTEGRATION_TESTING": 1
      }
   }

The `settings.json` file above will be scoped for the VSCode workspace. All the
configurations shown above are for the `CMake Tools` extension for VSCode. Now open
the local Karabo Framework repository working folder in VSCode by issuing the
following commands::

   cd [KARABO_FRAMEWORK_DIR]
   code .

VSCode should detect the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the root of the Karabo Framework
working folder and ask you if you want to configure the CMake project. Just say
yes. Once the CMake project has been configured, you should see the following contents
in the CMake Project Outline view of VSCode:

.. image:: img/cmake_project_outline.png


2. Using your VSCode Environment
================================


2.1. Build the Karabo Framework
-------------------------------

To build the whole Karabo C++ Framework, please select the `Build All Projects`
in the CMake Project Outline view (highlighted in yellow in the image below).

.. image:: img/karabo_cmake_buildAll.png

If your CMake Project Outline view happens to empty, press the
`Configure All Projects` button that is to the left of the `Build All Projects`
button, in the same toolbar. That should execute the configure and generate
phases of the Karabo's Framework CMake project, and populate the previously
empty view.

If you don't want to press `Configure All Projects` in order to
have the CMake project outline updated, please open your Workspace preferences
and check that the `Cmake: Configure on Edit` and `Cmake: Configure on Open`
options are enabled (highlighted in yellow in the image below):

.. image:: img/cmake_tools_options.png

2.2. Run and Debug the Framework Tests
--------------------------------------

To run one of the Framework unit or integration tests, right-click on its
project node in the CMake Project Outline view - one of the `*Runner` nodes under
`karabo-cpp-unit-tests` or `karabo-cpp-intergration-tests` in the first image of
section 2.1. The context menu will have options to `Build`, `Debug`, and `Run`
the corresponding test.

If you prefer to run more than one test at once, please open a terminal, either
internal or external to VSCode, go to your build directory and issue a `ctest`
command. In the example below, all tests are run in the default non verbose
mode::

   cd ../../build_debug_karaboCpp
   ctest

It is also possible to run all tests whose names match a given regular expression
in either verbose mode (`-V` option) or extra verbose mode (`-VV`). In the example
below, `dataLoggingIntegrTestRunner` is the only test run, and in extra verbose
mode::

   ctest -VV -R dataLogging*

Verbose and extra verbose modes cause `ctest` to output, among other things,
one line per successful test case execution. The default verbosity
level only emits intermediate reports for failed test cases - the number of
successful test cases executed, without their names, is reported at the end
of the test execution while in default verbosity level.

`ctest` also supports a `-E` option which is the complement of the `-R` option,
meaning execute all tests that do not match the given regular expression.

Some tests, especially some of the integration tests, require a `KARABO`
environment properly set. As the CMake build tree is not a full-blown Karabo
installation, you will need to `source` the `activateKarabo.sh` script before
running your test. That script is generated by the CMake build and is tailored
to your build tree. There are two ways of establishing a proper `KARABO`
environment in order to run tests and utilities, e.g. `karabo-brokermessagelogger`,
from the build tree:

* Launch VSCode from a shell where `source [BULD_TREE_PATH]/activateKarabo.sh`
  has already been executed, or,

* From the internal VSCode terminal session, execute the command
  `source [BUILD_TREE_PATH]/activateKarabo.sh`. Please be sure that you're
  issuing the command from the right internal terminal session - the one with
  `CMake/Launch` title in the terminal toolbar (picture below).
